##### **Dataset**

The data relates to athletes competing in the decathlon over two meetings, Decastar and OlympicG.

Their times and distances are recorded, as is their placing in the competition and the number of points they scored overall. There are 41 records in the dataset. 

<br/> 

##### **Cleaning**

The dataset had row names which recorded the name of the athlete. As the data was read-in, the row names were flipped to become a new variable in the table. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
rownames_to_column("athlete") 
```

A number of amendments to the table variables was made after the data had been read-in:

  * a prefix of "x" was removed from a number variable names
  * the data type of `competition` was changed from `factor` to `character`
  * the values within `athlete` were formatted to read properly 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
decathlon_data <- decathlon_data %>% 
  rename("100m" = "x100m", 
         "400m" = "x400m",
         "110m_hurdle" = "x110m_hurdle",
         "1500m" = "x1500m") %>% 
  mutate(competition = as.character(competition)) %>% 
  mutate(athlete = str_to_title(athlete))
```


<br/> 

##### **Question 1**

The longest long jump in either competition.

```{r}
decathlon %>% 
  select(athlete, long_jump) %>% 
  arrange(desc(long_jump)) %>% 
  head(1)
```
<br/> 

##### **Question 2**

The average 100m time in each competition.

```{r}
decathlon %>%
  group_by(competition) %>%
  summarise(avg_100m_time = mean(`100m`))
```
<br/> 

##### **Question 3**

The athlete with the highest total points across both competitions.

```{r}
decathlon %>% 
  group_by(athlete) %>% 
  summarise(total_points = sum(points)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(total_points)) %>% 
  head(1)
```
<br/> 

##### **Question 4**

The shot-put 1, 2 and 3 from both competitions.

```{r}
decathlon %>% 
  group_by(competition, athlete) %>% 
  summarise(shot_put) %>% 
  slice_max(shot_put, n = 3) %>% 
  arrange(desc(shot_put))
```
<br/> 

##### **Question 5**

Identifying which competitors ran the 400m in under 50 seconds...

```{r}
decathlon <- decathlon %>% 
  mutate("400m_in_less_50s" = case_when(
    `400m` < 50.0 ~ TRUE, 
    TRUE ~ FALSE
  ), .after = `400m`) 
```

... allows the competitors to be split and their average points calculated. 

```{r}
decathlon %>% 
  group_by(`400m_in_less_50s`) %>% 
  summarise(avg_points = mean(points)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_points))
```
