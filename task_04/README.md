This task relates to Halloween and the opinion of trick-or-treaters from around the globe (although mainly the USA) as to whether they valued the sweets (or candy) they received, whether they were disappointed by them or just indifferent to them. 

Almost 10,000 responses were collected over the 3 years from 2015 to 2017 and collected in 3 different Excel spreadsheets. 

The three data sets were extensively cleaned and merged together. 

The cleaned data set could then be interrogated to answer questions such as the average age of trick-or-treaters and which candy bar was valued the most by trick-or-treaters depending on their location, gender or the year in question.
