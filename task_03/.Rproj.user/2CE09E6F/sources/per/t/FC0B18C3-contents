```

```{r, include = FALSE}

seabirds <- read_csv(here("data_clean/bird_obs.csv"))
```

<br/> 

##### **Dataset**

The data for this task relates to 12,000 ship records of some 49,000 bird sightings made at sea, between 1975 and 1988. 

The dataset is split into two, one relating to the birds and another for the ship from which the birds were sighted. 

A huge number of entries were made for each record. There were 26 available categories for each bird sighted and 27 categories recorded data relating to the ship. 

<br/> 

##### **Assumptions**

Not all categories of data were needed. The bird data was reduced to 5 columns:

  * record_id
  * common_name
  * scientific_name
  * species_abbreviation
  * bird count

The ship data was narrowed to 3 columns:

  * record_id
  * latitude
  * longitude

<br/> 

##### **Cleaning**

Bird count values of `NA` were replaced with zeros. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
birds <- birds %>% 
  mutate(bird_count = coalesce(bird_count, 0))
```

The same process was undertaken for the ship's latitude and longitude. 

<br/> 
The ship and bird data was then joined to form one table which could be interrogated. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
bird_obs <- left_join(birds, ships, by = "record_id")
```

<br/> 

##### **Question 1.**

The question asks to find the bird species that was sighted most frequently, regardless of the number of birds actually counted 

The Wandering albatross sensu lato PL2 is the most frequently sighted bird. <br/> 

```{r}
seabirds %>% 
  group_by(common_name, scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(sightings = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sightings)) %>% 
  head(1)
```
<br/>

##### **Question 2.**

The bird with the highest total count is the Short-tailed shearwater. <br/>
```{r}
seabirds %>% 
  group_by(common_name, scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(sightings = sum(bird_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sightings)) %>% 
  head(1)
```

<br/>

##### **Question 3.**

As per Question 2 but for sightings above a latitude of -30 degrees, the Wedge-tailed shearwater has the highest count. <br/>

```{r}
seabirds %>% 
  filter(latitude > -30) %>% 
  group_by(common_name, scientific_name, species_abbreviation) %>% 
  summarise(sightings = sum(bird_count)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(sightings)) %>% 
  head(1)
```

<br/>

##### **Question 4.**

Selecting those birds that had been sighted in groups, allowed the birds who had only ever been sighted on their own to be isolated in the main `seabirds` table, as they didn't occur in the `birds_seen_in_groups` table. <br/>

```{r}
birds_seen_in_groups <- seabirds %>% 
  filter(bird_count > 1)

anti_join(seabirds, birds_seen_in_groups, by = "common_name") %>% 
  filter(bird_count == 1) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  summarise("seabird types" = n())
```
<br/>

##### **Question 5.**

The different types of penguin were identified by looking for the word 'penguin' (be it upper or lower case) anywhere in the bird's common name. <br/>

```{r}
pattern <- "(?i)penguin"

seabirds %>%
  mutate(penguin_detect = str_detect(common_name, pattern)) %>% 
  filter(penguin_detect) %>% 
  summarise("penguin_sightings" = sum(bird_count))
```
